# Tridentbert
Tridentbert is my take on a 300 x 300 x 250mm Voron Trident, a popular open source diy 3d printer, changed with all the best mods making this one of the most capable 3d printers on the market today.

# Improvements over a stock Voron Trident
> [!CAUTION]
> This design is based on and will only with Takeoff toolhead and Chube hotend. This is because of the changed gantry height so that Takeoff wont hit one of the z leadscrews.
> **Using a more standard Voron toolhead might result in the nozzle not beeing able to reach the bed!**

* 4040 based 20 extrusions for increased frame rigidity, which helps when printing at high speed and with high belt tension.
* 6mm aluminium panels all around the machine, to increase rigidity even more.
* Monolith 9mm AWD sheet metal gantry which is the best gantry design currently on the market.
* Using Takeoff toolhead with Chube and a CNC Sherpa Mini extruder for maximum extrusion performance.
* Z stepper motors mounted directly to the bottom aluminum panel for easy mounting.
* Electronics are mounted on the side for super easy maintenance.
